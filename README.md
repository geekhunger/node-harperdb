# Why?

[HarperDB](https://harperdb.io) is a distributed realtime JSON cloud database. It's highly scalable, has low-latency and is super easy to use and maintain. There are even build-in cloud functions, loadbalancing and other great goodies! Their free tier service plan is certainly capable of running decent applications too. But, their [HTTP API](https://api.harperdb.io) is not a turnkey solution.
